Code: Adapt Ready Offline Coding Challenge.ipynb

Input files: names.txt and hospitals.txt

* The code for the selected challenge is provided in a Python notebook, along with the input files required to run the code. 
* The cells in the notebook can be re-executed to run the code for the selected challenge.

* I have used the simple LSTM deep learning model for text generation. We can use GANs also for generating the text accurately based on the input data.
